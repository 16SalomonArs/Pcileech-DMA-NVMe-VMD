### Beater DC is a scammer!

I am writing this to warn the community about the channel admin Beater DC. We collaborated on firmware development from March 2025 to September 2025, during which he consistently withheld my payments.

In early September, when I finally demanded the payment I was owed, he reacted by kicking me and several other developers out of the server. Beater DC is a fraud who exploits developers for his own profit. Do not do business with him—protect your work and your money!
