### Beater DC is a scammer!
Beater DC is a scammer! Since our cooperation began in March, the channel admin has repeatedly delayed paying me for the firmware work I produced. At the beginning of September, when I asked for my payment, he kicked me and other developers out of the server! Beater DC is a fraudster who exploited me and my friends for profit. Don’t fall for his tricks.
